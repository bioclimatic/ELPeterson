Tasks and Duties
1987 Lead Mechanical Engineer, Medley, Greijmans and Flowers (MGF), Darwin. I took responsibility as MGF's Certifying Mechanical Engineer approved by the Building Practitioners Board of the Northern Territory. I made it possible for MGF to provide air-conditioning design and construction administration in Darwin and the top end of Australia. Extreme heat and humidity was challenging, but I always developed practical solutions to satisfy clients, Founders retired, so please ask Craig McClintock to verify.
Representative Projects
Nightcliff Hotel. I sorted out the client's initial dissatisfaction with island grill cooking exhausts. This required careful calculations and modifications of the previous unsuccessful design/installation of others.

Woolworths Downtown Darwin Supermarket Condensing Units. I designed condensing unit shrouds to prevent recirculation within urban canyon at the rear of the premises,

Berry Springs Territory Wildlife Park managed by NT National Parks and Wildlife Service. I designed and documented air-conditioning climate control of the nocturnal animal display hall. This required me to detail individually controlled enclosures for distinctive habitats of Australia's vast Norther Territory, ranging from desert to monsoonal forests.
