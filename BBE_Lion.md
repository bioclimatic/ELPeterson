1983 BBE Project example. 
Lion Nathan Breweries, East TƒÅmaki, Auckland. 
My manager and Senior Sales Engineer were challenged by cavitation . 
I assisted in resolution of client dissatisfaction by over-engineering the Net Positive Suction Head availability (NPSHa) 
beyond the published pump performance curves for water by relocation of pumps at lowest possible point in the facility. 
I argued successfully that the substantial increase in fluid pressure at the pump inlet would exceed the vapour pressure of 
carbon dioxide in fermenting beer.
