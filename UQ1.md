Duration	25% (6 months)
Tasks and Duties
University of Queensland School of Biological Sciences Sessional Lecturer 2002-2004 and Centre for Marine Studies Adjunct Research Fellow 2002-2012

Concurrent with employment in the government of the State of Queensland I was employed by the University of Queensland (UQ) to provide sessional teaching in Aquacultural Engineering two years.
This employment was contingent upon my honorary appointment as a researcher in Centre for Marine Studies (CMS).

My service as Aquacultural Engineer was initially recommended by Professor John Lucas, on the basis of my previous research focused on energy conservation and waste water treatment, but I built upon my placement at UQ to initiate research modelling coral reef atoll hydrodynamics.

Note that CMS has respawned in recent years, as UQ realizes the value of contributions such as I demonstrated as their Senior Adjunct Research Fellow.
Representative Projects
[MARS6017] Aquaculture Principles 2003 and 2004 I designed and delivered Aquacultural Engineering lectures and practicals. These I improved upon what I had developed at James Cook University. This required design, procurement and setup of tanks, pumps and pipework to practically demonstrate principle of aquaculture system design and commissioning. I clearly recommended in my lectures that aquaculture facility developers should employ specialist consulting engineers to design complex systems.

I responded to the climate crisis by analysis and recommendation to CMS's management how to implement on-site renewable energy generation and energy efficiency demonstrations. Some of my recommendations, such as HVAC controls in response to wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) were eventually implemented in the development of the Global Change Institute Building.
