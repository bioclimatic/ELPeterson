Tasks and Duties
As Sunwater Program Manager (Mechanical) I developed and maintained information management and reporting systems to ensure that the company complies with Work Health and Safety legislation related to mechanical plant such as cranes, pressure vessels, and cathodic protection systems. My secondment to SunWater was driven by the semi-decadal relicensing term of cranes, pressure vessels, and cathodic protection systems. Since reorganization of SunWater to facilitate selling off assets to local enterprises, I was tasked to support local managers to take responsibility to ensure assets are maintained, and that their staff are properly trained to do so without top-down program management from Brisbane. SunWater Infrastructure Management - dams, pipelines and pump stations. 2012 Program management secondment at SunWater - management of infrastructure and supervisory management of a network of local managers. So I audited SAP database of asset condition. Previously my work at Project Services focused on energy efficiency initiatives such as six-star Green Star, quality assurance during 12 month defect liability periods. and numerous courthouse and police station chiller replacements.
Representative Projects
For SunWater Infrastructure Management, I personally audited regional offices to work with local managers to ensure the government owned corporation’s plant and equipment did not fall out of proper maintenance and licensing at 19 major dams; 63 weirs/ barrages; 84 major pumping stations; and 2,700km of pipeline. I worked as Infrastructure Management Program Manager, mentoring Project Managers and Mechanical Maintenance staff to ensure they were continually upskilled. For example I was active in the Australasian Corrosion Association to ensure my regional collogues would be given the training opportunities available in Brisbane. This required me to make the case in head office for funding regional training as well as equipment for our asset managers to maintain safe and effective cathodic protection of the company pipelines.

At SunWater I responded to any and all requests for technical assistance where local resources were not sufficient. For example in 2012 I travelled to the Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory to inspect flap gate hydraulics on Scrivener Dam on Lake Burley Griffin. Here I worked with the operating technicians to establish a monitoring regime to keep track of creep in the aging hydraulics to inform reactive prioritization of capital retrofitting program in progress.

At Project Services I worked in 2011 as a thermal energy storage designer for conversion of the former QUT university campus to prove a whole-of-government office development. This allowed me to repurpose my previous design from the Queensland State Archives Thermal Energy Storage (TES), adapted to suit as required. So I worked with a senior mechanical designer, using his load calculations to adjust my calculations and analysis and thence to enable me to schematically design the latest TES and integration associated chilled water plant.

At Project Services in 2011 I also developed business cases at Aquatic Facilities of the Sunshine Coast and Toowoomba Regional Councils, managing energy-efficiency initiatives at council chambers, offices, workshops, as well as the $1.2 M AUD provision of process control systems for Aquatic Centres (some of which may provide venues for the 2032 Olympic Games). This work involved my design, procurement and tendering and associated supervision for the deployment of feedback control systems to ensure performance.

Also at Project Services in 2011 I managed $500k AUD Replaced Milne Bay Aquatic Centre in Towoomba with a HVAC deep retrofit 100% fresh air with energy recovery. This required me to design a program of temporary removal of the roof for change out of the plant, all during the lowest likely period of rain.

As yet another example of my 2011 work at Project Services I made the business case for chiller replacements at police stations and courthouses, among which Maroochydore was |I facility I had design original installation when I was employed by Norman Disney and Young more than 20 years previously. I was very pleased how my original layout of the courthouse chiller plant room made the replacement a very smooth operation without expose to the elements.
