Wesley Hospital was one of NDY's clients, 
where I designed and supervised commissioning of piped medical gases in the obstetrics/genecology wing. 
I also designed ventilation containment of radio-isotope hot-benches in the hospital, 
including exhaust stack injection well above the building boundary layer. 
Also I designed acoustic screening of the hospital cooling towers so as to mitigate complaints from neighbors.
