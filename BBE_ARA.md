## 1983 project example. 
Auckland Regional Authority (ARA) water treatment pump, integrated within the Hunua Scheme. 
I won ARA tender to supply a high volume electricity driven pumpset with certification of performance curves. 
I organised sub-contracting Auckland University Hydraulics lab in collaboration with Professor Raudkivi 
to provide certified performance curves to ARA together with the pumpset. 
I oversized a few percent on the basis of catalogue curves and ordered the pump from from a trusted casting facility in Malaysia. 
I designed and managed impeller-trim, assembly of pump, mechanical seals, motor, baseplate, coupling, 
and drive-guard as per my normal practice. 
On this project I organized testing of the assembly at the University of Auckland and subsequent delivery to ARA's 
Ardmore Water Treatment facility.
