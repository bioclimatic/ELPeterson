Another NDY project that I took charge of was mechanical services for a very large multi-level mall in suburban Brisbane:
Carindale Regional Shopping Centre Redevelopment. 
I provided site surveys of existing plant and developed a schematic design for extensive expansion of the 
shopping center. 
With mentorship from senior engineer Russell Brothers I convinced the architect to avoid the direct solar 
load associated with horizontal skylights. 
We won the consultancy services and I subsequently led design development and contract documentation of HVAC. 
With the assistance of Eddie Groves we implemented carbon monoxide monitoring process-control of carpark ventilation 
systems to a speed controlled system to reduce energy costs while maintaining safety of air quality.
