Representative Projects
[ME4515] Advanced Mechanical Engineering Design, 1998 - I redesigned and delivered the whole of the subject. I obtained copyright to reproduce the Australian government's adaptation of the Carrier Air-conditioning Method to Estimate Loads (CAMEL) and taught my students how to design HVAC in compliance with government procurement guidelines and to estimate costs in alignment with accepted quality surveying methods. Then I tasked the students to assess their Student Union Refectory to be air-conditioned, and submitted for funding. It was accepted by student council and their documents which I quality assured were used to tender an installation, which student have enjoyed ever since.

[CM4002] Construction Technology,1998 heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, plumbing. I focused on teaching basic room load estimation for simple installations that can be specified by non-engineer technicians such as my construction management students would be recruited to fulfil such roles. I stressed that more complex systems require consultation with qualified Mechanical Engineers.
