Employer	Brown Brothers Engineers
State/Province	Auckland (New Zealand)
Title	Sales Engineer (Full-time)
Employment Dates	Dec. 1982 — Apr. 1984
Duration	100% (1 year, 4 months)
Tasks and Duties
Design and supply electric- and engine-driven pumping systems.

I was mentored by senior staff, and I was subsequently responsible to supervise clerical, workshop, and spare parts staff, and to liaise with our factory in Christchurch New Zealand, as well as the Grundfos factory in Australia as their exclusive agents in New Zealand. I was trained to responded to any and all manor of inquiries with quotations and supply on order. My manager authorized and encouraged me to offer to deliver solutions to any customer's fluid pumping requirements, even if we had to buy in equipment from competitors or import from overseas and resell at a loss in order to protect our reputation as a one stop shop. Meanwhile in the evenings I attended Graduate Engineer programs of Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ), where I learned that it would be more appropriate for me to move into a consulting engineering practice, as I did at conclusion of my service to Brown Brothers.

I developed and implemented solution strategies to reach a broad range of clients. Focused on issues of Net Positive Suction head (NPSH), design of controls transmissions, motors and engine drivers.

I organized custom manufacturing with NZ, and when necessary managed imports from overseas.

I provided numerous bespoke household sewerage handling systems.

I designed and supplied numerous horticultural Irrigation schemesm, drawn from boreholes as well as rivers.

I arranged bronze casting of casings and impellers for corrosive applications such as marine bilge pumps.

About 40% of my time was spent on non-engineering tasks such as management of subordinates and engagement with clients and suppliers. Although I provided my Manager and superiors with engineering solutions to automate and streamline such workflows ... such as computer programming pump and and system dynamic curves and integrating with the corporate quotation system.
Representative Projects
1983 project example. Auckland Regional Authority (ARA) water treatment pump, integrated within the Hunua Scheme. I won ARA tender to supply a high volume electricity driven pumpset with certification of performance curves. I organised sub-contracting Auckland University Hydraulics lab in collaboration with Professor Raudkivi to provide certified performance curves to ARA together with the pumpset. I oversized a few percent on the basis of catalogue curves and ordered the pump from from a trusted casting facility in Malaysia. I designed and managed impeller-trim, assembly of pump, mechanical seals, motor, baseplate, coupling, and drive-guard as per my normal practice. On this project I organized testing of the assembly at the University of Auckland and subsequent delivery to ARA's Ardmore Water Treatment facility.


1983 Project example. Lion Nathan Breweries, East Tāmaki, Auckland. My manager and Senior Sales Engineer were challenged by cavitation . I assisted in resolution of client dissatisfaction by over-engineering the Net Positive Suction Head availability (NPSHa) beyond the published pump performance curves for water by relocation of pumps at lowest possible point in the facility. I argued successfully that the substantial increase in fluid pressure at the pump inlet would exceed the vapour pressure of carbon dioxide in fermenting beer.


1984 Project example. New Zealand Synthetic Fuels Corporation Limited (Synfuel) fire fighting pump. Delivered to Synfuel gas-to-gasoline complex, Motunui facility converting natural gas into gasoline which employs fixed bed catalytic process using zeolite catalyst. I designed, specified assembly, commissioned, and delivered the trailer mounted high volume pumpset including diesel engine required for fire suppression at the complex, located in Taranaki New Zealand.
