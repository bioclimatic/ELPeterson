Duration	100% (1 year, 4 months)
Senior Collegue: Warren Edwin Ubels (warren@technipump.co.nz)
Tasks and Duties
Design and supply electric- and engine-driven pumping systems.

I was mentored by senior staff, and I was subsequently responsible to supervise clerical, workshop, and spare parts staff, and to liaise with our factory in Christchurch New Zealand, as well as the Grundfos factory in Australia as their exclusive agents in New Zealand. I was trained to responded to any and all manor of inquiries with quotations and supply on order. My manager authorized and encouraged me to offer to deliver solutions to any customer's fluid pumping requirements, even if we had to buy in equipment from competitors or import from overseas and resell at a loss in order to protect our reputation as a one stop shop. Meanwhile in the evenings I attended Graduate Engineer programs of Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ), where I learned that it would be more appropriate for me to move into a consulting engineering practice, as I did at conclusion of my service to Brown Brothers.

I developed and implemented solution strategies to reach a broad range of clients. Focused on issues of Net Positive Suction head (NPSH), design of controls transmissions, motors and engine drivers.

I organized custom manufacturing with NZ, and when necessary managed imports from overseas.

I provided numerous bespoke household sewerage handling systems.

I designed and supplied numerous horticultural Irrigation schemesm, drawn from boreholes as well as rivers.

I arranged bronze casting of casings and impellers for corrosive applications such as marine bilge pumps.

About 40% of my time was spent on non-engineering tasks such as management of subordinates and engagement with clients and suppliers. Although I provided my Manager and superiors with engineering solutions to automate and streamline such workflows ... such as computer programming pump and and system dynamic curves and integrating with the corporate quotation system.
