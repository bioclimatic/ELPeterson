I took responsibility of one of NDY's clients' pavilions at the 1988 Worlds Fair in Brisbane. For the
Expo '88 Suncorp Pavilion, I designed evaporative cooling at the client's direction after having warned them that 
humidity would likely become uncomfortably humid by October 1987. 
And sure enough the client requested additional serves to replace evaporative cooling, 
and so I worked with mechanical services the contractor 
during the World's Fair Exhibition period to replace the HVAC installation without disturbing international visitors.
