Tasks and Duties
I was employed as a Lecturer in the School of Marine Biology and Aquaculture, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia. I taught Aquaculture subjects and delivered research report to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on effluent mixing zones from aquaculture farms. I was tasked with adapting the lecture notes and practical demonstrations that Dr Trevor Anderson had used as a Lecturer until his sudden recruitment by industry as an Aquacultural Engineer and Facility Manager. I embellished and enhanced the subjects by integration of my postgraduate research and engagement with the leaders of the aquaculture industry, CSIRO and DPI research experts, and my engineering expertise in pumping and HVAC.
Representative Projects
James Cook University Aquacultural Engineering) Subjects that I taught 2002

[AQ3008 /5008] Aquaculture: Systems Design 2002 (covering departure of T.Anderson). I delivered this course both the undergraduate and postgraduate students, with appropriately different homework and examination assessments for these distinctive cohorts of developing professionals. I made clear where facility managers need to engage specialist consultants such as Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineers to ensure the safety and suitability of dams & levees, turbo-machinery & pipework, as well as switchboards & controls such as earth-leakage trips. I also focused on the Environmental regulations imposed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority where I concurrently was collaborating with for the development of guidelines for the monitoring and management of aquaculture effluent.

[AQ3005/5005] Aquaculture Systems Management 2002 (collaboration with R. de Nys). I assisted by delivering some lecturers focused on the role of professional engineers in the development of aquaculture facilities.

[AQ5010] Aquaculture: Production & Evaluation Report (collaboration with C. Zeng). I provided practical mentorship of final year students designing, procurement of materials, assembly and operating a barramundi growout with recycling of effluent into hydroponic production of produce. The previous years' student project pipework and equipment were salvaged and qualified before I approved the students' procurement of necessary new pipe and fittings. The students organized a BBQ with their harvest at the end of the academic year, with proceeds returned to the accounts of the School of Marine Biology and Aquaculture for the following years' cohort of final year-student project AQ5000.
