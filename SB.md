Tasks and Duties
I was tasked to collaborate with EPCO Australia and our team at Simmonds & Bristow to developed packaged waste water treatment plant pre-engineered and certified for a wider market. I was individually assigned the goal of guiding our company to manufacture such packaged waste water treatment plant, based on established market in regional and remote communities. I worked on re-purposing shipping containers as the plant exoskeleton. I applied my expertise in pumps and reverse osmosis membranes to investigate the challenges and opportunities of membrane bioreactors.
Representative Projects
Papua New Guinea highlands (Ialibu-Pangia District), I assisted in preparing a tender for delivery of a waste water treatment plant to be assembled onsite. While others in our supply chain prepared design for fabrication of exoskeleton to be bolted together from small panels I assisted in design of the mechanical components of the treatment train. I assisted in modularizing the initial tertiary treatment capacity so that additional throughput could be incrementally managed in future as the sewerage system of the community was expected to increase over time.

For more general deployment, I drafted concept designs for modular deployment of wastewater treatment plant in ISO highcube shipping containers. I worked closely with our in-house process engineer to agree upon process flow diagrams and control schemes for the package plant. An important aspect of the work was to provide membrane clarifier module to avoid the large large area used by conventional sedimentation. I obtained multiple quotations from component suppliers for a nominal capacity so that our company sales engineers could quote a cost ex-works Brisbane.
